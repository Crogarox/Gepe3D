- make a "state" class which encapsulates functionality like accessing/modifying fields, so
  you don't have to keep doing state[ x(i) ] or derivative[ vx(i) ]; make it able to be inherited
  so different types of states can have different structures (e.g. SoftBodyState)

- maybe make it like an attribute list data structure that could be universal to state, derivative and change alike
  (like SoftBodyAttribs)

- allow customisation of physics body drawing process

- not all physics objects will have vertices and faces (like smoke and fluids), put vertex functionality in a mesh class?

- draw particles in the fluid body class

- SSAO for the particles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hxrPKoELpo&ab_channel=BrianWill

- make it so vertex attributes actually have a name and are not refered to by ID
