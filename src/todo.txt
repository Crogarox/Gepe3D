todo

- make a "state" class which encapsulates functionality like accessing/modifying fields, so
  you don't have to keep doing state[ x(i) ] or derivative[ vx(i) ]; make it able to be inherited
  so different types of states can have different structures (e.g. SoftBodyState)

- maybe make it like an attribute list data structure that could be universal to state, derivative and change alike
  (like SoftBodyAttribs)


- separate out render and update function for them to happen at different frequencies
